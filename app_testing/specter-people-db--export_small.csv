ðŸ‘‹ WHY ME?

After I sold my first startup (Paladin), several founder friends reached out to me. They wanted to know what it was like and what I learned in the process.

A few of them were thinking about selling their companies and asked if I would help. After all, I understood the industry and probably knew most of the potential buyers.

So I agreed to help a few of those friends and found myself with a new side hustle as a boutique investment banker.

After cutting my teeth on a few deals, I realized how much I love working with entrepreneurs, so I decided to make it official and launched Quartermast Advisors.

ðŸ¤ WHAT WE OFFER:

We manage the entire M&A process from start to finish, which includes:

âœ­ Preparing your materials (CIM, financials, etc.)
âœ­ Identifying and getting in touch with the right buyers
âœ­ Negotiating the deal structure and economics
âœ­ Coordinating with legal and tax experts to protect your interests
âœ­ Everything else it takes to get the deal over the finish line

ðŸ¤” WHY WORK WITH AN M&A ADVISOR?

Research shows that hiring a banker results in ~25% higher valuation premiums, on average.

It also frees founders up to continue operating the business and hit their targets. There's nothing worse than poor company performance during a sales process, so it's often more valuable to focus on delivering good results rather than managing M&A discussions.

ðŸ‘¨â€ðŸ’» WHO I HELP:

I stick to what I know: media, tech, and the creator economy. Our firm has helped sell influencer agencies, talent management firms, enterprise SaaS companies, and more.

If youâ€™ve been approached or are just thinking about selling your company now or in the future, shoot me a note. Iâ€™d be happy to chat and answer any questions.

If Iâ€™m the right fit, Iâ€™d love to help you out. And if Iâ€™m not, Iâ€™ll gladly point you in the right direction.

I am an internet entrepreneur, a believer in technology for good, an eCommerce trailblazer, and a proud Non-Executive Director on public companies board. My previous life include launching Amazon in France (amazon.fr), spearheading Meetic (largest European dating app acquired by Match.com) through to IPO, and starting and growing one of the largest internet media company in France and in Europe, Carat Interactive (now part of the Dentsu Group).

As a wife, a mother, a citizen of the world and a woman in business who went all the way to the boardroom, I think we are now ready to create a real, intentional, large space for other ways to do things in a more inclusive way. Today, in an increasingly speedy, complex, uncertain and  interconnected world, recreating balance becomes a necessity to face the challenges and opportunities of change. We need to operate from a different point of view with co-creation and collaboration, trust and belonging ... and love at the heart of the way to lead. This is why I founded MixR, my latest venture. 

Fun facts: I have learned the art of customer-centricity with The Source (Jeff Bezos), I used to practice track and field in competition, I am a kundalini yoga teacher, I have written a book, I love to learn & share & teach. I am grateful for my challenges (even if sometimes it takes me time to realize:-). I feel very lucky to live in todayâ€™s time.

My parents always thought it was a strange combination, but were proud that I graduated with a double major in Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University's Pratt School of Engineering. 

Figuring out how to weave my talents together to form a career was challenging.

It wasnâ€™t until I joined an early-stage startup Mint.com, as the founding engineer where I was instrumental in building the prototype, launching, and scaling it to serve millions, that I realized I enjoyed being an engineering lead.

While coding, shipping products, and scaling bring me joy, I know that it's only possible when you recruit, train, and coach your employees consistently. To that end, I've recruited, onboarded, and grown on-site and remote engineering and product teams across the US, Europe, and Asia for web and mobile software products at early-stage startups and Fortune 500s.

I love to share my experience with others through writing and speaking. I published two books: How to Transform Your Ideas into Software Products http://femgineer.com/transform-ideas/ and Present! A Techieâ€™s Guide to Public Speaking http://femgineer.com/present-book/. And spoken at nearly 80+ companies across the San Francisco Bay Area, and 100+ conferences and events worldwide on software engineering, entrepreneurship, product development, public speaking, and leadership: http://femgineer.com/speaking.

I used to host and co-produce a web show called Build (2015-2019), sponsored by Pivotal Tracker https://www.youtube.com/user/Femgineers, and ran an online course called the Confident Communicator Course (2016-2019), which taught people how to give technical talks http://femgineer.com/confident-communicator-course/.

per_7242a6c2f5d759d9538b6cf1,,,,B.,Pagels-Minor,B. Pagels-Minor,https://www.linkedin.com/in/bpagelsminor,,,"I believe in mutual accountability and scalable processes that allow teams to do the work well and evolve with technology. 

You can find me dishing out real talk via their podcast or blog on why product strategy is about scaling with intention. B. traveled from Mississippi to Chicago to Silicon Valley and now Los Angeles for over a decade, producing products that shifted the culture for Fortune 500 brands, including Apple and Netflix. 

With an MBA and MIS and an undergraduate degree from Northwestern University, my approach to every problem consists of strategy, curiosity, and genuine authenticity as a product strategist and leads with empathy and radical candor in every consultation. 

Named 40 Under 40 by Silicon Valley Business Journal. B. Pagels-Minor is on a mission to help companies create sustainable solutions. My credentials do the talking, but my record is nothing to play with, nor is my trivia facts knowledge. 

Folks say I am a captivating and inspiring speaker, a fierce advocate for those from historically underinvested communities, and a thought leader on product and culture development within big techâ€”naturally, I am also first to the tech news and toys. 

I love building community, promoting diversity in tech, and prioritizing giving back to organizations like Howard Brown Health, rooted in LGBTQ liberation, and the YWCA of Metropolitan Chicago on their board of directors.
